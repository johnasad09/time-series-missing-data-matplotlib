# Time-Series Analysis and Visualization in Python

This repository contains my learning progress and projects on **time-series data analysis** using Python.  
I explore techniques to make time-series data comparable, handle missing values, and create professional visualizations.

## What I Learned
-  Resampling and converting time-series data (e.g., daily â†’ monthly)
-  Fine-tuning Matplotlib charts: limits, labels, linestyles, markers, colours, and resolution
-  Using grids to visualize seasonality in time series
-  Finding and handling missing or NaN values in Pandas
-  Working with Locators to better style time axes
-  Applying previous concepts to new datasets for deeper understanding

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
